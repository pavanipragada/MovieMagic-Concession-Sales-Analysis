# Project Overview:
* This repository contains an in-depth analysis conducted for MovieMagic, a movie chain in the southwest region. The project aims to identify factors influencing concession sales and improve the prediction of the amount spent on concessions. The analysis involves three main components:

## Linear Regression Analysis:
* Determine significant predictors influencing concession spending.
* Identify multicollinearity among predictors.
* Assess positive and negative influences of predictors on the amount spent.
  
## Penalized Regression Analysis:
* Evaluate relevant variables for predicting concession sales.
* Compare the effectiveness of Ridge and LASSO in selecting relevant predictors.
* Analyze how different data splits (70-30 vs. 80-20) influence regression metrics.

## Text Analysis:
* Visualize customer reviews through word clouds for different star ratings.
* Implement Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling.
* Provide business strategy recommendations based on the inferred topics.

## Questions Answered:
* Identify significant predictors and detect multicollinearity.
* Determine positive and negative influences on concession spending.
* Contrast linear regression and penalized regression for variable selection.
* Analyze the impact of different data splits on regression metrics.
* Propose strategies to increase concession sales based on regression analysis.
* Visualize prominent words in customer reviews through word clouds.
* Implement LDA for topic modeling and suggest business strategies based on inferred topics.
